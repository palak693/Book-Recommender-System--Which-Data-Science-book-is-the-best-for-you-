# Book-Recommender-System--Which-Data-Science-book-is-the-best-for-you-
In this project, I have built a book recommender system that summarizes reviews and ratings off of Amazon and helps one pick the best (DS) for onself.


Functionality:
- Performs EDA for simple questions which still don't entirely fint tune the recommendation process


- Usage of K-Means Clustering and tfidf vectorization to get titles of books clustered with the interest of common themes


- Usage of BeautifulSoup to scrape reviews off of Amazon 


- Summarization of reviews using BERT summarizer
